# Render Wiki Action

Action to allow rendering of wiki contents from executable build artifacts.

Useful if there are several executables in a repository which provide usage comments and documentation when executed. By specifying the wiki config yaml, any usage comments can be included in the markdown wiki.

This action currently overwrites the contents of a wiki, it does not clean the folder first.
